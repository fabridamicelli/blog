# Example Markdown Post

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1

## Code

You can format text and code per usual 

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

    2

Formatting text as shell commands:

```shell
echo "hello world"
./some_script.sh --option "value"
wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png
```

Formatting text as YAML:

```yaml
key: value
- another_key: "another value"
```


## Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|-|-|
| A thing | Another thing |
