Hi, I'm Fabrizio. Thanks for your visit!

I am currently a PhD Student at the [Institute of Computational Neuroscience](https://www.uke.de/english/departments-institutes/institutes/computational-neuroscience/research/index.html) in Hamburg (Germany) and [Claus Hilgetag](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qceKVpYAAAAJ&hl=en) is my supervisor.

Self-taugh coder, strong open-source and team-work and advocate.
I like music a lot, Python, berries and simple ideas behind complex phenomena.
I prefer strong intuitions and simple words to unnecessary sophistication and difficult jargon.

Feel free to get in touch on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fabridamicelli) or drop me an e-mail f.{mylastname}@uke.de.

## Research
### Short
Our group is interested in fundamental principles of brain connectivity and how they sculpt brain function.
By means of computational analysis and modeling, we try to understand how the connectivity of brain networks comes about and underlies higher level properties.
My research topic is about modeling how some features of brain networks emerge.
In particular, I try to model how different plasticity mechanisms shape some topological features of brain networks.

### Not-so-short
The conceptual framework is a branch of Network Science, namely *Network Neuroscience*.
[Network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science) looks at complex systems from a particular point of view, taking advantage of some mathematical tools coming from [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) to represent the complex system at hand.

Why networks?
Because they are useful abstractions.
The most fundamental reason for that is that networks are all about *relationships* between elements, captured as *links* between elements of the network (*nodes*).
In fact, the minimal description of a network is a list of *links*.

We can thus think of the brain (or a part of it) as say dots (neurons, regions) connected by lines (dendrites, axons), i.e., a *network*.
Once we have that representation we can describe what we see, for example, how many areas have a given number of links (a.k.a. *degree distribution*).
People have carried out experiments and described brain connectivity of several species (some of that research belonging to a field known as *connectomics*).

When we look at those networks derived from connectivity data we find that some properties appear almost all the time.
Of course, there are many nuances in the data, the analyses and interpretations that make the general principles less straight forward.
Nevertheless, some principles of brain connectivity are pretty characteristic (although not necessarily exclusive of brains).
For example, the *degree distribution* referred above tends to be very heterogeneous, with a few regions having disproportionately many links while the vast majority of regions present a much smaller number of connections.
Our work focuses on trying to understand *why* that is the case.
In other words, figuring out potential mechanisms that could explain *how* those brain networks get shaped into the connectivity patterns observed in nature.
