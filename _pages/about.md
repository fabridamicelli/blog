Hi, I'm Fabrizio. Thanks for your visit!

I am currently a PhD Student at the [Institute of Computational Neuroscience](https://www.uke.de/english/departments-institutes/institutes/computational-neuroscience/research/index.html) in Hamburg (Germany) and [Claus Hilgetag](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qceKVpYAAAAJ&hl=en) is my supervisor.

Self-taugh coder, strong open-source and team-work advocate.
I like music a lot, Python, berries, reading, simple ideas behind complex phenomena and data-driven solutions.
I prefer strong intuitions and simple words to unnecessary sophistication and difficult jargon.

Feel free to get in touch on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fabridamicelli), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabridamicelli) or just drop me an [e-mail](mailto:f.damicelli@uke.de).
